# Discord-Nitro-API.py
Just a basic nitro gen made with python

if you have python installed already you can just download the source and run it
if you dont have python installed, install it or the .pyc version

(alt): no install required: https://replit.com/@prim722/Nitro-Gen#main.py

be sure to add more proxies becuase the ones i added was for testing so i didnt add many
